**I** am a programmer and hobbyist game developer. I work as a full-stack devops engineer for [Unity Technologies][1] in [the Monetization organization][2]. Previously, I taught introductory programming and received my B.S. in Computer Science from the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering][3] at the University of Washington.

In my free time, I am developing a digital adaptation of one of my favorite card games. I adore game development and art of many forms.

*It is important to me that creative tools be accessible to anyone, regardless of their ethnicity, gender, or other aspects of identity.*
